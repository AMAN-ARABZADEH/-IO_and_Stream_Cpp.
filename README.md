# I/O and Stream Manipulators

This code demonstrates various aspects of input/output (I/O) operations and the usage of stream manipulators in C++. It covers different scenarios and features related to I/O and stream formatting. Let's explore the code and its components.

## Introduction
The code begins by including necessary libraries for I/O and stream manipulators. It also includes the `<iomanip>` library for working with stream manipulators. Then, a helper function `isInteger` is defined to validate if a given string represents an integer.

## Example 1: String Streams
The first example showcases the usage of `std::stringstream`. It constructs a string stream, inserts multiple values, and retrieves the resulting string. The resulting string is then printed to the console.

## Example 2: Integer Validation
This example demonstrates a loop that prompts the user to enter an integer. It reads the user input, validates it using the `isInteger` function, and provides feedback based on the validity of the input. The loop continues until a valid integer is entered.

## Example 3: ostringstream
In this example, an `std::ostringstream` object is used to construct a string by inserting integer, floating-point, and string values. The resulting string is then printed to the console.

## Example 4: Validator Function
The code introduces a function called `isInteger` that uses `std::stringstream` to validate if a given string represents an integer.

## I/O Examples
After the previous examples, the code showcases different I/O operations and stream manipulators. Each example is preceded by comments explaining the purpose and usage of the specific manipulators.

## File I/O Example
The code includes an example of file input/output (I/O). It demonstrates writing to a file using `std::ofstream` and reading from a file using `std::ifstream`. It opens the file "output.txt" for writing, writes some text to it, and closes the file. Then it opens the same file for reading, reads each line, and prints it to the console.

## Conclusion
This code provides a comprehensive demonstration of I/O operations, stream manipulators, and file I/O in C++. It covers different scenarios and shows how to perform input/output operations, format output, validate input, and read from/write to files. The comments throughout the code provide explanations and guide you through the different examples and concepts.
