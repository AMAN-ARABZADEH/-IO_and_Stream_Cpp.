## Introduction

C++ provides powerful features for handling input/output operations and stream manipulations. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing applications that interact with users, read from or write to files, and format data for display. This repository aims to provide clear and concise examples of different I/O and stream-related functionalities in C++.

## Examples

### String Streams

The `stringStreamsExample()` function demonstrates the usage of string streams. It shows how to insert values into a string stream, retrieve the resulting string, and print it to the console.

### Validating Integer Input

The `validateIntegerInput()` function illustrates the process of validating user input to ensure it represents a valid integer. It prompts the user to enter an integer and performs the necessary checks using string streams.

### OStringstream

The `ostringstreamExample()` function showcases the usage of `ostringstream` to construct a string by concatenating different types of data, such as integers and floating-point numbers.

### Validating Integer Input with Do-While Loop

The `validateIntegerInputDoWhile()` function presents an alternative approach to validating integer input. It uses a `do-while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user until a valid integer is entered.

### Input/Output Operations

The `ioExample()` function demonstrates basic input/output operations using `std::cin` and `std::cout`. It prompts the user to enter a number and displays the entered value.

### Stream Manipulators

The `streamManipulatorsExample()` function showcases various stream manipulators available in C++. It covers formatting options such as precision, width, fill characters, alignment, base representations, and more.

### File Input/Output

The `fileIOExample()` function provides an example of file input/output operations. It shows how to write data to a file using `std::ofstream` and read data from a file using `std::ifstream`.
